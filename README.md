### Client: The Gaming Room

The gaming room wants to expand its android based game: Draw It or Lose It to the web-based game as well as to iOS devices. The key requirement is to support multiple teams with each team having multiple players. Also, it needs to support all modern browsers. 

This document provides key information about the high-level overview of the application. I have made recommendations in various areas. I have provided a thorough comparison between different operating systems and the reason for choosing Linux based on the user requirements and constraints. I have also explained the reason for using the cloud-based system than on-premise servers. 

The UML diagram provides the overall structure and architecture of the application. Looking into the UML, we can see the relationship between different entities. This helps in developing different entities such as interfaces, classes, etc, and connections between them. 

I would pick the evaluation section to include the testing of different browsers in different operating systems. As our application is a web-based application, we need to test different browsers in different operating systems. 

Collecting user stories is the early step of any project. We need to translate that user story into the requirements. This is the way to estimate the project duration. As the overall project is based on the user's need, we carefully analyze it and communicate back and forth to solidify it. The translated user requirements have an important role in choosing the right operating platform and tools. 

Starting is the key even if it doesn't look good at the beginning. We need to iteratively improve it based on our understanding of the user's needs. It needs to satisfy the client and its users, not us. So, we need to think what is the best possible approach. This needs market comparison, cost analysis, and feasibility study.
